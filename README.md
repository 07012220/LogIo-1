# LogIo

 Log I/O is a library for reading and writing well log files.

As of Q2/2018 Log I/O supports DLIS, LIS, LAS 2.0, LAS 3.0, BIT, XTF, ASC,
SPWLA, CSV, and JSON Well Log Format. Log I/O wraps the complexity of these
formats in a clean, complete, well documented, efficient and extremely simple
to use programming API.

The open source version of Log I/O available here is the Java accessor for the
JSON Well Log Format.

## Setup

Capture the UoM code to local disk by:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Petroware/LogIo.git
```


## Dependencies

The JSON Well Log Format accessor depends on the JSON API specification
and an implementation of this. We are using the official one from Oracle,
but these can probably be replaced if required:

```
lib/javax.json-api-1.1.3.jar
lib/javax.json-1.1.3.jar
```

## Programming examples
